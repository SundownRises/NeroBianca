# NeroBianca
Gaming deals must be black and white, not gray.
We are building a game-asset marketplace



A concise, trustless gaming–asset marketplace, nero‑bianca brings in‑game items and account data on‑chain using NERO Chain’s Account Abstraction and Paymaster. By auto‑creating smart‑contract wallets, sponsoring initial gas fees, and issuing nontransferable “soul‑bound” credibility tokens, it streamlines user onboarding and fraud prevention. Underlying escrow contracts enforce atomic trades, while arbiters validate completions and earn reputation tokens. The result is a single‑token, user‑friendly ecosystem for secure, decentralized trading of PUBG, CS:GO, and cross‑platform assets—without complexities of multi‑token economies.





What It Does



Automated Wallet Onboarding: Users sign in via Web2 accounts (email, OAuth), triggering AA‑Platform to deploy a smart‑contract wallet invisibly on NERO Chain 

docs.nerochain.io





Trustless Escrow Trading: In‑game assets (skins, accounts, progression) are locked in a bespoke escrow smart contract that releases items only upon mutual confirmation or arbiter approval.

The arbiters will be responsible for actual asset and token transfer.





Gas Sponsorship & Token Payments: All initial transactions are covered via the Paymaster system; we will be extensively using nero's account-abstraction infrastructure for enhanced UX and lower barrier to entry for users on our platform.





How we are going to use Nero's AA



1. Gasless Onboarding (Type-0 Transactions)

New users get 10–15 free transactions, enough for 2–3 full trades.



NeroChain’s Paymaster (Type-0) sponsors 100% of gas fees.



Smooth Web2-like entry with no need for native tokens.



 2. ERC-20 Token-Based Gas (Type-1 Transactions)

After free quota, users prepay gas using ERC-20 tokens (e.g. USDC, WETH).



No need to hold NERO token; gas auto-deducted from user-approved ERC-20 balance.



Keeps UX clean – users interact without worrying about gas logistics.



 3. Smart Contract-Powered Escrow Trading

Trades occur through trustless escrow contracts using ERC-20 tokens.



Escrow holds both assets and funds, then atomically swaps upon fulfillment.



Built-in support for arbiter-led dispute resolution.



 4. On-Chain Reputation via Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)

Non-transferable SBTs issued to buyers, sellers, and arbiters after each successful trade.



SBTs reflect user credibility and transaction history.



Used for reputation scores, arbitration credibility, and platform trust.



 5. Permanent Gasless Trading for Trusted Users

High-value contributors (reliable sellers, buyers, and arbiters) get lifetime gas sponsorship.



Funded by a portion of escrow contract fees.



Encourages loyalty and good behavior with VIP-like experience.



 6. Security-First Approach (No Session Keys)

Every transaction is explicitly signed by the user.



No background delegations = reduced risk of abuse.



Reinforces user control and security for valuable digital goods.

	

On‑Chain Reputation with Soul‑Bound Tokens: Every transaction yields non‑transferable reputation and credibility tokens, letting counterparties verify trustworthiness before trading 







The Problem It Solves



Complex Onboarding & Gas Hassles: Traditional Web3 platforms require manual wallet setup and crypto purchases, blocking mainstream gamers. nero‑bianca’s AA flow eradicates these hurdles.



High Risk of Scams: Third‑party markets (e.g., TradeIt.gg, CS.Money) have suffered high‑profile thefts—over $6 M in CS:GO skins were stolen in August 2022 alone. 



Fragmented Asset Trading: Cross‑platform games (Overwatch 2, Modern Warships, Rocket League) lack unified, tamper‑proof marketplaces, leading to lost assets and disputes. An on‑chain escrow creates one secure hub.







Technologies I  will use



Blockchain & AA: NERO Chain with Blockspace 2.0, ERC‑4337 account abstraction, and the AA‑Platform Paymaster 

docs.nerochain.io



Smart Contracts: Solidity + OpenZeppelin’s Escrow and AccessControl libraries for secure, upgradeable contracts 

Documentation - OpenZeppelin Docs



Frontend & Auth: Next.js (SSR), RainbowKit / Wagmi for wallet connectivity, and Web2 login adapters, secure password authentication and passkeys



Storage & Deployment: Lighthouse.storage for off‑chain metadata; Vercel for frontend hosting; Foundry for contract testing and deployment.

Encrypted and user-based token gating on storage so that even on public network, only allowed stakeholders can access details of the trade.







How We’re Going to Build It



AA Wallet & Paymaster Setup: Use NERO’s AA wallet tutorials to configure UserOperation flows, deploy escrow contracts, and fund sponsorship pools, attach paymaster API to our escrow and periphery contract.

docs.nerochain.io





Escrow Contract Development: Implement a minimal‑trust escrow pattern (lock → validate → release) using OpenZeppelin’s base Escrow as a template 





Frontend Integration: Embed AA SDK calls in Next.js pages to create and sign UserOperations, handle Paymaster policies, and display transaction status in real time.



Soul‑Bound Reputation: Develop an SBT contract to mint nontransferable tokens upon successful trades, encoding ratings and arbiter feedback

⚠️ Third-Party Risks & Our Solution
Popular trading platforms like Tradeit.gg, CS.MONEY, and DMarket offer item trading but are prone to scams and security breaches—a notable case in 2022 involved $6M worth of stolen CS:GO skins.

To counter these risks, our platform provides:

Trustless escrow trading using smart contracts

Account abstraction & soul-bound tokens for user credibility

Fraud prevention via real-time monitoring and verification

Educational tools for safe trading practices
